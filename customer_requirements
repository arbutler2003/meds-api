1. Executive Summary
HealthGuard Inc. requires a backend service that allows patients to quickly check medication safety. The system must
retrieve up-to-date drug labeling information from federal databases and serve it to our mobile app with low latency.


2. Functional Requirements
These are the specific behaviors the system must support:

REQ-1 (Drug Search): The system must accept a generic or brand drug name (e.g., "Ibuprofen") and return the official
FDA "Warnings" and "Adverse Reactions."

REQ-2 (Interaction Check): The system must allow users to view specific "Drug Interactions" for a medication to see
what other drugs might react with it.

REQ-3 (Response Format): All data must be returned in standard JSON format so our mobile app team can easily read it.


3. Non-Functional Requirements
These are the constraints on performance and architecture:

REQ-4 (Performance/Caching): Frequent searches must return results in under 200ms. To achieve this, the system must
implement caching (Redis) for results that have been fetched within the last 24 hours.

REQ-5 (Portability): The entire application (API + Database) must launch with a single command using Docker, ensuring
no manual installation of Python dependencies is required for new developers.
